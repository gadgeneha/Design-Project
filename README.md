## Design-Project
This is an incremental design project done in Human Computer Interaction.
This project is done in 5 stages:

### Stage 1 : 
Selection of topic. The topic is selected as 'Daily Transportation and the problems associated with it'. It was later modified into : Efficiency of navigation apps both indoors and outdoors.

### Stage 2 : 
  A formative research is done for the above mentioned topic and observations are written down based on interviews and field notes.

### Stage 3 : 
  Construction of problem statement and data analysis is done using affinity diagrams and thematic network diagrams. User personas are created to understand the perspective of target customers.

### Stage 4 :
  a. Different brain storming sessions (individual and group) are performed to identify possible solutions to the problem defined in previous steps.
  b.  Three most important issues that need to be addressed are identified.
  c. Design solutions are proposed for the identified issues. Two storyboards are created for each design solution by creating               sample personas.
  d. One most efficient solution design choice is selected for moving ahead.
          
### Stage 5 : 
  A prototype is created for the final design choice. Evaluation of the prototype is conducted through Cognitive Walkthrough Report and Usability Aspect Report.
